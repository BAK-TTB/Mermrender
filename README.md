# Mermaid-Renderer
https://mermaidjs.github.io/

RESTful rendering pipeline for generating sequence and UML diagrams using Mermaid.

### Motivation 
Github doesn't support rendering Mermaid diagrams in their Markdown editor. Mermaid is a powerful tool that uses a well-defined schema to then interpret diagrams into an SVG. The idea of this tool is to allow embedding images dynamically via a REST endpoint to add UML/Sequence diagrams into your documentation/readmes/markdown files easily, whether the editor supports Mermaid or not.
